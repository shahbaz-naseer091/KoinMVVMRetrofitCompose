This is an example of implementing the MVVM architecture in Kotlin, with a Compose UI, API calls using Retrofit, and Dependency Injection with Koin.

**Technologies Used**
Kotlin: Programming language used for development.
MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel architecture for separating UI logic from business logic.
Jetpack Compose: Modern Android UI toolkit for building UIs in a declarative way.
Retrofit: HTTP client for making API calls.
Koin: Dependency Injection framework used to manage dependencies.

**Features**
Implements MVVM architecture to maintain a clean separation between UI and business logic.
Uses Jetpack Compose for building the UI in a declarative and modern way.
API integration with Retrofit to fetch data from a remote server.
Dependency injection handled using Koin for a simplified and modular architecture.

**Setup Instructions**
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

Android Studio (latest stable version)
JDK 11+ (Java Development Kit)
Git for version control
Steps to Run the Project
Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
git clone https://github.com/shahbaz-naseer091/KoinMVVMRetrofitCompose.git

Open the project: Open the project in Android Studio.

Install dependencies: After opening the project, sync the Gradle files to ensure that all required dependencies are downloaded:

Go to File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.
Configure API base URL: Ensure you have the correct base URL for the API calls in your project. This can usually be found in the Retrofit service class or in build.gradle if you're using any constants for the base URL.

Run the app: You can now build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

Click on Run (green play button) in Android Studio or press Shift + F10.
